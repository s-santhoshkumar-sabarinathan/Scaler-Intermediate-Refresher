Problem Description
You are given an integer A as input and you need to determine whether it is a palindrome or not.
A palindrome integer is one whose digits, when reversed, result in the same number.
For example, 121 is a palindrome because its reverse is also 121, but 123 is not a palindrome because its reverse is 321.
Note: The given integer will not have any leading zeros.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 106

Input Format
First and the only line contains a single integer A.

Output Format
Print Yes if it is palindromic, else print No.

Example Input
Input 1:
 120
Input 2:
 1001
Input 3:
 131

Example Output
Output 1:
 No
Output 2:
 Yes
Output 3:
 Yes

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 For A = 120, reverse(A) = reverse(120) = 021 = 21 (removing leading zeroes). 120 is not equal to 21
Explanation 2:
 For A = 1001, reverse(A) = reverse(1001) = 1001, which is same as A.
Explanation 3:
 For A = 131, reverse(A) = reverse(131) = 131, which is same as A.
