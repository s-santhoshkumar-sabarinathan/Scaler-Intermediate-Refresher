Problem Description
You are given the Cost Price C and Selling Price S of a Product.
You have to tell whether there is a Profit or Loss. Also, calculate total profit or loss.
NOTE: It is guaranteed that Cost Price and Selling Price are not equal.
NOTE: You have to take input of the Cost Price(C) and Selling Price(S) from the user.

Problem Constraints
1 <= C, S <= 109
C ≠ S

Input Format
First line of the input contains a single integer C.
Second line of the input contains a single integer S.

Output Format
Print two integers in separate lines.
First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.
Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.

Example Input
Input 1:
 2
 4
Input 2:
 4
 1

Example Output
Output 1:
 1
 2
Output 2:
 -1
 3

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Cost Price = 2
 Selling Price = 4
 As Cost Price < Selling Price, there is a profit.
 Total Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 4 - 2 = 2
Explanation 2:
 Cost Price = 4
 Selling Price = 1
 As Cost Price > Selling Price, there is a loss.
 Total Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 4 - 1 = 3
